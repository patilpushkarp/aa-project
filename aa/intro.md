# Project: Advanced Analytics - I

In this project, we intend to perform a risk analysis of companies based on their credit ratings. Classification algorithms will be used to predict the credit ratings of the companies. Then, one company will be selected to perform an in-depth analysis by using the CAPM model and Fama French Model.
