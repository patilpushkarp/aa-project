# Regression Results

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(knitr)
```

Every algorithm has its own pros and cons depending upon the underlying assumptions and statistical methods used. Thus, to summarize

```{r}
df <- read.csv("./../data/regression_data/output/result.csv")
kable(df)
```

For this case, Random Forest algorithm has given the best performance.
